# Joinify

How do you figure out what to do in a city or place that you have never been before?
 
It is of course possible to google your way around and see, but the entire experience of figuring out what fun events are nearby in a new place is totally impractical. 
 
Maybe there is a local food market. Maybe there is a local soccer game. Maybe there is a concert somewhere, the locals will know, but you will have a hard time figuring it out.

This project is aimed at developing a solution to this problem. 
The platform will utilize existing web-technologies to make a highly scalable system that enables users to create and discover events in the local area.
